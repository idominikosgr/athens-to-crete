# Athens to Crete

An integration-first engineering methodology, packaged as the **crete** plugin for Claude Code and as portable prompts for Codex and other AGENTS.md-aware tools.

One core idea: **don't build roads across seas, don't invent shipcopters - use boats.** Understand the real problem, map the constraints, reuse what exists, and verify the path end-to-end before and after building.

## What's in here

```
.claude-plugin/     plugin.json + marketplace.json (Claude Code plugin: "crete")
commands/           10 slash commands (/crete:think-first, /crete:build-connected, ...)
agents/             4 subagents the commands orchestrate
skills/             athens-to-crete skill (auto-activates on implementation work)
hooks/              SessionStart philosophy reminder
AGENTS.md           portable playbook for Codex / any AGENTS.md-aware agent
scripts/            install-codex.sh
```

### Commands

| Command | Phase | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `/crete:start-session` | kickoff | Load project context before any coding |
| `/crete:discovery` | kickoff | Map workflows and current state; writes `product-understanding.md` |
| `/crete:think-first <feature>` | before code | Problem analysis via solution-architect; blueprint before implementation |
| `/crete:review-approach` | before code | Build / don't build / redesign recommendation |
| `/crete:build-connected <feature>` | build | Full pipeline: architecture → strategy → implement → validate → flow-test |
| `/crete:implement [story]` | build | Implementation mode with quality gates |
| `/crete:refocus` | drift | Reset when execution loses the real problem |
| `/crete:validate-coherence <area>` | after code | Completeness and connectivity check |
| `/crete:find-orphans` | after code | Dead/disconnected code scan |
| `/crete:project-synthesis <project>` | whole project | Reconcile docs, code, and vision into a coherent plan |

### Agents

- **solution-architect** - maps the complete solution space before code; produces the blueprint
- **implementation-strategist** - dependency-ordered build plan
- **coherence-validator** - post-build reachability/completeness/integration/orphan check
- **flow-analyzer** - end-to-end journey validation

The commands orchestrate these in sequence; each agent is also independently invocable.

## Install (Claude Code)

```
/plugin marketplace add idominikosgr/athens-to-crete
/plugin install crete
```

Or for local development: `claude plugin add ./` from this repo, or add the repo path as a local marketplace.

## Install (Codex)

```bash
./scripts/install-codex.sh    # symlinks commands into ~/.codex/prompts as /crete-*
cp AGENTS.md <your-project>/  # the methodology itself, agent-agnostic
```

Codex has no subagents; AGENTS.md includes an inline-phase mapping for each agent reference.

## Works with mnemosyne

If the [mnemosyne](https://github.com/entro314-labs/mnemosyne) plugin is installed, the context-gathering commands (`start-session`, `discovery`, `think-first`) automatically recall prior decisions and session history via its MCP tools, and `discovery` distills durable findings into memory files mnemosyne can re-serve. Everything degrades gracefully when it isn't installed.

## Why this exists

To keep engineering work practical, modern, and coherent - especially when moving fast. Code that compiles is not code that solves the problem; every feature must be a bridge, not an island.
